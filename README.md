# Redstor FE Challenger

Welcome to Redstor's challenger app! This is a playground for you to try out new ideas and put your skills to the test.

As part of our interview process, we would like to invite you to collaborate with us, building or improving experiences on our Redstor Challenger App that uses the Unsplash API.

## What would you do with the Unsplash API? 

The Unsplash API is a modern JSON API that surfaces all of the info you’ll need to build any experience for users.

To begin, visit https://unsplash.com/developers, establish a new developer account, and integrate the API key into the environment.ts file.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Suggestions

- Start by taking a look at `https://github.com/redstor/redstor-fe-challenge/issues`. This is where we've listed areas where there's room for improvement.
- Explore and make changes as you see fit. There are no rules, so let your imagination run wild!
- If you have a great idea, feel free to log an issue for it.
- Don't forget to have fun!
